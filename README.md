# JustAPerfectTheme
Automatically change the theme from light to dark if the night-mode is enabled in GNOME. It can also change the gedit theme to make it more readable at night.

## Installation
Download the files and give the following command from the terminal:
```$ chmod +x .JustTheme.sh ; mv .JustTheme.sh ~; mv JustTheme.sh ~/.config/autostart/```

## Set custom theme
Open the script `.JustTheme.sh` and set the name of your favourite themes in the first lines.

## Credits
JustPerfection is the original author of the script that I heavenly edited. I really really really want to thank him for his help and availability. THANK YOU, JUSTPY!
